                         DNS Queries over HTTPS
                      draft-hoffman-dns-over-http

Abstract

   This document describes how to make DNS queries and get DNS responses
   over HTTPS.  The main driver for this document is to allow clients
   who want to send DNS queries over HTTP transport to be able to do in
   a secure and interoperable fashion, regardless of the format of the
   responses.

1.  Introduction

   Over time, there have been many proposals for using HTTP and HTTPS as
   a substrate for DNS queries and responses.  To date, none of those
   proposals have made it beyond early discussion, partially due to
   disagreement about what is the "best" method to do so.  In
   particular, there has been disagreement about what the best format
   for the responses should be.  Also, some early proposals have not
   followed best practices for using HTTP.

   This document defines a specific protocol for sending DNS [RFC1035]
   queries and getting DNS responses over HTTP [RFC7230] that is running
   over TLS [RFC5246].  Although there might be a desire to run this
   protocol over an insecure transport such as bare HTTP, this document
   only defines the protocol as HTTP over TLS.

   This design focuses on DNS stub-to-resolver communication, but DNS
   resolver-to-authoritative communication should work just as well.

   A server that supports this protocol is called a "DNS API server" to
   differentiate it from a "DNS server" (one that uses the regular DNS
   protocol).  Similarly, a client supports this protocol is called a
   "DNS API client".

1.1.  Use Cases

   Earlier proposals for DNS over HTTP have had many different use
   cases.  The primary use case is an application that wants to avoid
   network path involvement with DNS.  The protocol can be implemented
   in the application such as a browser if the location of the DNS API
   server can be configured, hard-coded, or discoverable such as through
   DHCP.

   Another use case is an operating system that wants to help
   applications when the OS detects broken DNS in its operations.  The
   OS can still respond to calls such as getaddrinfo() and
   gethostbyname() by using this protocol without the applications
   needing to do anything.

   A more recent use case is a small ("IoT") device that already runs
   COAP [RFC7252] and has a JSON [RFC7159] or CBOR [RFC7049] parser and
   wants to make DNS queries beyond what are supported by the device's
   operating system.

   An eventual use case might be editing of DNS zones by end users, such
   as described in [I-D.hildebrand-deth].  Such editing could easily be
   done using existing HTTP semantics.

   As HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and QUIC [I-D.hamilton-early-deployment-quic]
   become more widely deployed, this protocols might become more
   important because an HTTP/2 or QUIC server might push DNS responses
   to a client that the HTTP/2 server expects the client to look up.

1.2.  Protocol Requirements

   The protocol described here bases its design on the following
   protocol requirements:

   o  The protocol must use HTTP semantics the way that they are
      commonly used in other protocols; there is nothing special about
      the DNS use case.

   o  The protocol must run over secure transport.

   o  The query format must be able to be flexible enough to express
      every normal DNS query.

   o  The response must be able to be in different formats that can be
      described by different documents.

   o  Both the query format and the response formats must be extensible.
      In specific, a query must be able to contain one or more EDNS

      extensions, including those not yet defined.  Further, it must be
      easy to define different response formats and to extend already-
      defined formats.

   Non-requirements:

   o  Supporting network-specific DNS64 [RFC6147]

   o  Supporting other network-specific inferences from plaintext DNS
      queries

1.3.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.4.  Template

   The URI template (see [RFC6570]) for DNS API queries is:

   {PREFIX}{QNAME}/{QTYPE}

   The following variables are used to expand the URI template.

1.4.1.  PREFIX

   "PREFIX" will be a URI fragment, such as "https://example.net/api/".
   The URI protocol MUST be "https:" or "coaps:".

   The DNS API client discovers the PREFIX for the DNS API through the
   same mechanism as for a DNS resolver: DHCPv4, DHCPv6, IPv6 RA, and
   configuration.  Specific PREFIX discovery mechanisms will be defined
   later, but imagine a new RA option like that in [RFC6106] that gives
   a PREFIX.

   If no PREFIX is configured as above, the client MAY query their
   existing DNS server for API support by doing a URI query (see
   [RFC7553]) to the domain "_dnsapi.invalid".  If the DNS server knows
   about API support, the resulting URI will be the PREFIX.

   Note: there are several concerns to be worked out with respect to the
   PREFIX, including how to bootstrap PREFIXes that contain domain
   names, and how to trust TLS connections to PREFIXes that contain only
   IP addresses in a deployable way.

1.4.2.  QNAME

   The QNAME from [RFC1035].

   Note: An open issue exists with how to encode non-ASCII QNAMEs.
   There are several options:

   o  Punycode all labels before sending

   o  Send the UTF8-encoded version after normalization, but before
      Punycoding

   o  Send generic UTF8-encoded labels, and make the server do
      normalization

1.4.3.  QTYPE

   The numerical QTYPE from [RFC1035].

   Note: there are some people that want to use the string forms, such
   as "AAAA", perhaps in addition to the numerical form.  To be
   discussed.

1.5.  Additional Parameters

   The following are the names and descriptions of parameters for DNS
   API queries.  All parameters are optional.  DNS header values and
   extensions that are not appropriate for queries are not defined.
   Each parameter in the list below will need to include a use case in a
   later version of this document; this list is a first approximation of
   what may be needed.

   Each of these parameters may be used in a query component of the URI
   sent to the API, to modify the request.

   qc:  QCLASS from [RFC1035] - if omitted, server assumes 1 (IN).
      Might be needed to support legacy DNS classes, or to access
      interesting new DNS capabilities.

   id:  ID from [RFC1035] - if omitted, there is no default value.
      Could be used to track responses.

   opcode:  Opcode from [RFC1035] - if omitted, server assumes 0
      (standard query)

   rd:  RD from [RFC1035] - if omitted, server assumes 1 (recursion
      desired)

   cd:  CD from [RFC4035] - if omitted, server assumes 1 (DNSSec
      checking by the resolver disabled)

   do:  DO from [RFC4035] - if omitted, server assumes 1 (include RRSIG
      RDATA in the response)

   The following are EDNS0 [RFC6891] extensions.  If an extension is
   omitted, the server assumes that the extension was not given in the
   request.

   nsid:  Request the server's NSID, based on [RFC5001].  Set to "1" to
      enable.

   dau:  Specify the list of signing algorithms understood, based on
      [RFC6975].  The value is a list of integers separated by commas
      (with no spaces).

   dhu:  Specify the list of hash algorithms understood, based on
      [RFC6975].  The value is a list of integers separated by commas
      (with no spaces).

   n3u:  Specify the list of NSEC3 hash algorithms understood, based on
      [RFC6975].  The value is a list of integers separated by commas
      (with no spaces).

   ecs:  Specify the client subnet, based on [RFC7871].  The value is
      the bytes of the ECS option, starting with byte 4, encoded in
      lowercase hexadecimal.

   pad:  Optional padding, used for the same purposes as described in
      [RFC7830].  This can be used to normalize the length of queries.

   See Section 3 for a registry for additional names for queries.

1.6.  Queries

   To send a DNS query, the DNS API client prepares an HTTP/CoAP GET
   request and sends it to the URI it received from the discovery step.
   Additional Section 1.5 (if any) are specified.

   The HTTP-related requirements include:

   o  The HTTP GET request MUST have no body.

   o  The HTTP GET request SHOULD be sent with an HTTP "Accept:" header
      to say what type of content can be returned.  If the request does
      not have an HTTP "Accept:" header, the DNS API server might return
      a content type that the DNS API client does not understand.

Internet-Draft                 DNS in JSON                September 2016


   o  The HTTP GET request SHOULD use If-None-Match headers if earlier
      responses to the same query used HTTP ETag headers as described in
      [RFC7232].

   For example, assume that the server's template for the query is:

      https://dnsserver.example.net/{QNAME}/{QTYPE}

   A query for the A records for www.example.com would be:

      https://dnsserver.example.net/www.example.com/1

   The HTTP request might look like:

      GET www.example.com/1 HTTP/1.1
      User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3
      Host: dnsserver.example.net
      Accept: application/dns+json

   This document only defines the semantics of the HTTP/CoAP GET command
   for normal DNS queries and responses.  Other verbs will be defined in
   the future.  Other verbs will likely need different authorization
   semantics as well as different discoverability for the template.  For
   example, see [I-D.hildebrand-deth].

1.7.  Discovery

   1.  Look for configured URL.  If it exists, and does not use IPv4 or
       IPv6 as the host name, look the host name up using the existing
       DNS infrastructure.  TODO: decide if this affects the
       applicability for this protocol, and discuss the trade-offs of
       requiring valid certificates for IP addresses for configured
       HTTPS URLs.

   2.  Look for DHCP/DHCPv6/RA configured URL, and proceed as above.

   3.  Look for existing DNS server IPv4/IPv6 address.  Construct a URL
       of the form https://{IP}/

   For any of the above,

   TODO: decide whether the extra complexity of JSON-home is warranted
   vs. just specifying the template parameters in this document and
   having a single template URL be discoverable.

   A DNS API client discovers the capabilities of the DNS API server
   using [I-D.nottingham-json-home].  For queries, the link relation is
   TBD.

Internet-Draft                 DNS in JSON                September 2016


   Note that the response to this discovery might be multiple templates.
   In those templates, some of the URI types might not be supported by
   the resolver; this is fine as long as at least one type is.  For
   example, if a discovery query returns both https: and coaps: URI
   templates, but the DNS API client can only generate https: queries,
   the other URI templates are ignored.

   If a DNS API client only has a DNS resolver address but no
   configuration for a DNS API server, the client can still use the
   discovery query to see if that DNS resolver is acting as a DNS API
   server.  That is, some DNS resolvers will run both the DNS protocol
   on port 53 and the DNS API on a different port.

   The discovery response may give hints that the DNS API server
   requires a form of HTTP authorization.  The configuration of that
   authorization is out of scope for the DNS API protocol.  TODO: Need
   to think about HTTP authorization mechanisms.  This would allow user
   tracking, but could also free resolvers from having to use IP address
   ranges for filtering.  Several bad ideas are likely here, so let's
   think about it early.

   TODO: Need to think about how to get both an IP address and domain
   name for the SNI for HTTPS.  Some ideas might come from RFC 7858.

2.  Responses

   Different response formats will provide more or less information from
   a DNS response.  For example, one response type might include the
   information from the DNS header bytes while another might omit it.
   The amount and type of information that a response format gives is
   solely up to the format, and not defined in this protocol.

   At the time this is published, the response types are works in
   progress.  The know response types include:

   o  [I-D.hoffman-dns-in-json] describes a response type in JSON

   o  [I-D.song-dns-wireformat-http] describes a response type in DNS
      wire format

   In the HTTP responses, the HTTP cache headers are set to shortest DNS
   TTL in the response.  The HTTP responses SHOULD set the HTTP ETag
   headers as described in [RFC7232].

3.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: Create a new registry for option names for DNS queries.  This
   will be a simple registry for new option names, probably with a
   designated expert.

4.  Security Considerations

   This protocol requires the use of TLS for communication.  If a client
   does not enforce authentication of the TLS server, the communication
   channel will be susceptible to many security problems.  See [RFC7435]
   for a fuller description of non-authenticated TLS.

   TODO: Think about whether cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
   applies to this protocol and, if so, how to specify it.
